The following is a description of design philosphies and standards for liteshort. This document is mostly for developers, however if you are interested feel free to take a peek.

DESIGN PHILOSPHIES:
    - Liteshort should be light on hardware resources. It doesn't need to be as minimal as possible, however it should never use excessive amounts of memory or CPU time.
    - Liteshort should have readable code. Readability is more important than small performance gains.
    - Liteshort should be easily configurable. If something could be an option, it should be.
    - Liteshort should be simple to install and maintain. Installing should be a simple process, whether from a package manager or when installing from source.
    - Liteshort should follow system design standards. This includes basic Unix design principles and the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.


PROPOSAL FOR A DEBIAN PACKAGE

File Structure:
    x Debug Executable file: liteshort in $PATH
    x Hashpw executable file: lshash in $PATH
    x Source directory: system Python module folder (eg. /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/liteshort)
    x Config directory: /etc/liteshort/ OR appdirs.site_config_dir OR appdirs.user_config_dir
    - Socket file (if applicable): /run/liteshort.sock

Pypi Package:
    The PyPi package should provide no more than the following:
        x Install source to Python package directory
        x Install template config files
        x Install debug executables installed
        x Install minimum requirements (no uwsgi)

Debian Pacakge:
    The Debian package should provide no more than the following:
        - Install uwsgi
        - Install and enable systemd service
        - Should be based upon pybuild, as to prevent redundant packaging
