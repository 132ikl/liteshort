*Why liteshort over other URL shorteners?*

liteshort is designed with the main goal of being lightweight. It does away with all the frills of other link shorteners and allows the best of the basics at a small resource price. liteshort uses under 20 MB of memory idle, per worker. liteshort has an easy-to-use API and web interface. liteshort doesn't store any more information than necessary: just the long and short URLs. It does not log the date of creation, the remote IP, or any other information.

liteshort focuses on being configurable. There are over 15 config options and most updates will add more. Configuration is done through the easy-to-use YAML format.
